[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/poketo/poketo)](https://travis-ci.com/poketo/poketo)
[![Coverage](https://badgen.net/coveralls/c/github/poketo/poketo)](https://coveralls.io/github/poketo/poketo)
[![npm](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/v/poketo)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poketo)

Node library for scraping manga sites.

Provides a consistent API for scraping metadata and chapter images from 16+ manga sites. Makes it easy to build manga readers, downloaders, archival tools, and more.

For working examples, check out the [Poketo manga reader](https://poketo.app), or the [Poketo CLI](https://github.com/poketo/poketo-cli)!

People should be able to read content on the web in the way that works for them. Manga sites are often a special brand of bad. Each manga page loads a new web page, ads everywhere, yuck! Poketo opens up access to that content to make better tools on top.

> :construction: This project is still `v0.x.x` and the API may change as more sites are added.

## Install

```bash
npm install poketo --save
```

You can also use [api.poketo.app](https://api.poketo.app), a hosted micro-service for this library.

## Usage

```js
import poketo from 'poketo';

poketo.getSeries('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/').then(series => {
  console.log(series);
  //=> { id: 'meraki-scans:senryu-girl', title: 'Senryu Girl', chapters: [...], ... }
});

poketo.getChapter('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5/').then(chapter => {
  console.log(chapter);
  //=> { id: 'meraki-scans:senryu-girl:5', pages: [...], ... }
});
```

## API

Poketo exposes four methods:

```jsx
poketo.getSeries(idOrUrl: string): Promise<Series>
poketo.getChapter(idOrUrl: string): Promise<Chapter>
poketo.getType(input: string): 'series' | 'chapter'
poketo.constructUrl(id: string): string
```

To understand what is returned for a `Series` or `Chapter`, check out the examples below.

## Docs

- [Get series information](#get-series-information)
- [Get pages for a chapter](#get-pages-for-a-chapter)
- [Validate a URL or ID](#validate-a-url-or-id)
- [Convert an ID to a URL](#get-a-url-from-a-poketo-id)
- [Difference between an ID vs. URL](#whats-the-difference-between-an-id-and-a-url)
- [Error Handling](#error-handling)

### Get series information

Use `poketo.getSeries` to get the ID, title, cover image, and chapter listing for a manga series.

```js
poketo.getSeries('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl').then(series => {
  console.log(series);
});

// {
//   id: 'meraki-scans:senryu-girl',
//   slug: 'senryu-girl',
//   url: 'http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl',
//   title: 'Senryu Girl',
//   coverImageUrl: 'http://merakiscans.com/.../senryu_200x0.jpg',
//   chapters: [
//     {
//       id: 'meraki-scans:senryu-girl:1',
//       slug: '1',
//       chapterNumber: '1',
//       volumeNumber: '1',
//       title: '5-7-5 Girl',
//       createdAt: 1522811950
//     },
//     ...
//   ],
//   updatedAt: 1522811950,
// }
```

### Get pages for a chapter

Use `poketo.getChapter` to get a page listing for a chapter. This doesn't include any information about the chapter or series, just the page list.

Depending on the site, the page list will also include image dimensions.

```js
poketo.getChapter('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5').then(chapter => {
  console.log(chapter);
});

// {
//  id: 'meraki-scans:senryu-girl:5',
//  slug: '1',
//  url: 'http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5',
//  pages: [
//    { id: '01', url: 'http://merakiscans.com/image01.png', width: 800, height: 1200 },
//    { id: '02', url: 'http://merakiscans.com/image02.png', width: 800, height: 1200 },
//    ...
//  ]
// }
```

### Validate a URL or ID

If you have an arbitrary input, you can see if Poketo recognizes it by calling the `poketo.getType` method. It will return `'series'` or `'chapter'` if it's supported, or will throw [a Poketo error](#error-handling) if not.

```js
poketo.getType('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl');
//=> 'series'
poketo.getType('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5');
//=> 'chapter'
poketo.getType('http://merakiscans.com/i/am/a/banana/yo');
//=> throws a `poketo.InvalidUrlError`
poketo.getType('http://google.com');
//=> throws a `poketo.UnsupportedSiteError`
```

### Get a URL from a Poketo ID

If you've stored a Poketo ID, you can get a URL back out by using the `poketo.constructUrl` method. You can learn more about [the difference between IDs and URLs](#whats-the-difference-between-an-id-and-a-url).

```js
poketo.constructUrl('meraki-scans:senryu-girl:5');
//=> http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5

poketo.constructUrl('manga-stream:haikyuu:314/5286');
//=> https://readms.net/r/haikyuu/314/5286/1
```

### What's the difference between an ID and a URL?

Poketo scrapes information from many sites. To identify which _site_, _series_ (aka. manga), and _chapter_ you're talking about, Poketo lets you provide information in two ways: a Poketo ID or a URL.

These IDs below are equivalent to the URLs on their right:

```
ID                                URL
mangadex:13127:311433          →  https://mangadex.org/chapter/311433/1
meraki-scans:senryu-girl:5     →  http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/5
manga-stream:haikyuu:314/5286  →  https://readms.net/r/haikyuu/314/5286/1
```

For the `getSeries` and `getChapter` methods, you can provide either a URL, or an ID, like so:

```jsx
// Both lines return the same series
poketo.getSeries('http://merakiscans.com/senryu-girl/');
poketo.getSeries('meraki-scans:senryu-girl');

// Both lines return the same chapter
poketo.getChapter('https://mangadex.org/chapter/311433/1');
poketo.getChapter('mangadex:13127:311433');
```

#### Why use an ID?

Poketo IDs have stronger guarantees they won't change.

It's not uncommon for a site to change their domain name or URL structure. For example, MangaDex once changed URLs for manga series from `https://mangadex.org/manga/1234` to `https://mangadex.org/title/1234`. If that happens, your URL might break. But by using an ID, Poketo will know to do the right thing. This makes IDs a more robust way to store information about a series.

Of course, there are no true guarantees with scraping. Even an ID that works one day might break the next — but it's a _slightly_ better guarantee.

### Error Handling

Scraping isn't a perfect. When using Poketo you'll inevitably run into an error, so we try to make what happened as clear as possible.

- `RequestError` - unable to make a request to scrape the site
- `TimeoutError` - tried to make a request, but the source site didn't respond in a reasonable time. Defaults to 5 seconds.
- `HTTPError` - tried to scrape the site, but the site returned an error (eg. 404, 500)
- `LicenseError` - tried to scrape the site, but the series/chapter is current blocked, licensed, or was subjected to a DCMA takedown.
- `UnsupportedSiteError` - the site you're trying to scrape from isn't supported. If you'd like to see it supported, [make an issue!](https://github.com/poketo/poketo/issues/new)
- `UnsupportedOperationError` - some sites don't support reading chapters. This error is thrown if you call `poketo.getChapter` for these sites.
